Q: I can't close the program. What to do?
A:
-If there is a white Java icon on the taskbar (on the bottom of the screen), right click it and click close.
-Or on Windows, open the Task Manager (press Ctrl, Shift, and Escape at once), find "Java(TM) Platform binary" or "javaw.exe", select it and click "End task".

Q: The ghost clicks still deselects my right click menu. What to do?
A: I'm sorry, this is a big limitation of the program and can't be fixed.

Q: Sometimes it deselects the window I'm on. What to do?
A: It occurs when the ghost clicks perform a ghost zoom. Sorry I haven't been able to fix this although in theory it's possible.

Q: The mouse keeps moving to the disabled area. What to do?
A:
-Make sure the 2nd checkbox is checked. It says "try move mouse cursor back where it was before ghost click"
-Make sure your area is large enough. Occasionally when you move the mouse, the ghost click also moves a bit, and escapes the area.

Q: The area is too big and interferes with computer use. What to do?
A: If the area blocks some important buttons, check "allow mouse or touchpad to click in region" and set a minimum or maximum click duration (e.g. minimum 10ms, maximum 500ms if your mouse varies a lot). Ghost touches might be consistently 1ms.

Q: The ghost clicks still click on some menus and the taskbar. What to do?
A:
-Make sure the 1st checkbox is checked. It says "constantly ensure on front of special windows e.g. taskbar"
-Sometimes it can't be fixed.
