# Read below first:
# DisableLocalizedGhostClicking
Meant for people with touchscreens which click on their own (due to glitches or broken screen), but only in certain areas of the screen.


My guess is it only works on Windows.

To download from github:

-go to the page with this README file (you might be already on the right page)

-click "Download ZIP" (look to the right?)

-find the "DisableLocalizedGhostClicking.zip" file, and uncompress it. (On Windows, right click and select "Extract All...") There now should be a folder named "DisableLocalizedGhostClicking".

-delete the "DisableLocalizedGhostClicking.zip" file


To run it:

-Important: please save your work and close programs such as text editors before running. The program may crash your computer. 

-make sure you have java installed (one place to install: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

-either

---run "run.bat" (and a popup should appear)

-----this may only work in Windows

  or

---open command prompt and enter the "bin" folder inside the "DisableLocalizedGhostClicking"

---once in that folder, run "javaw DisableLocalizedGhostClicking". If javac is not found, you may type

-----"BlahBlah\Some Folder\Some Other Folder\Java\blah1.2.3_45\bin\javaw.exe" DisableLocalizedGhostClicking.java

  or

---open command prompt and enter the "src" folder inside the "DisableLocalizedGhostClicking"

---once in that folder, run "javac DisableLocalizedGhostClicking.java". If javac is not found, you may type

-----"BlahBlah\Some Folder\Some Other Folder\Java\jdk1.2.3_45\bin\javac.exe" DisableLocalizedGhostClicking.java

-----If you can't find any file named "javac.exe", download a jdk http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

-----Whether you use "\" or "/" depends on your operating system

---run "javaw DisableLocalizedGhostClicking"

I prefer the 3nd option because your computer might not allow the 1st or 2nd.

You can eztang00@gmail.com about any issues, especially cases where it crashes the computer.
