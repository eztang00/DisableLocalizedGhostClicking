# DisableLocalizedGhostClicking
Meant for people using touchscreens which click on their own (due to glitches or broken screen), but only on certain regions of the screen.


My guess is it only works on Windows.


To download from github:

-go to the page with this README file (you might be already on the right page)

-click "Download ZIP" (on the bottom right?)


To run it:

-make sure you have java installed

-uncompress the zip file

-either

---run "run.bat"

  or

---use command prompt to:

---compile the source code "javac DisableLocalizedGhostClicking/src/DisableLocalizedGhostClicking.java"

---run it "java DisableLocalizedGhostClicking"

I prefer the 2nd option because your computer might not allow the 1st.
