echo (I'm assuming you're using windows) If it says "'javaw' is not recognized", do the following. Double check you installed Java. Go to the Control Panel, type "System" in the search box, click "Edit the system environment variables", "Environment Variables...", scroll until you see "Path", select it, click "Edit...", click the leftmost of the Variable value textfield, (make sure it's NOT highlighted) type javaw.exe is, and then type a ";" (EXAMPLE: "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_45\bin;" yours will differ from the example)
pause
