DisableLocalizedGhostClicking

Meant for people with touchscreens which click on their own (due to glitches or broken screen), but only in certain areas of the screen.

My guess is it only works on Windows.

To download from github:
-go to the page with this README file
-click "Download ZIP" (look to the right?)

To run it:
-warning: please save your work and close programs such as text editors before running.
-make sure you have java installed
-uncompress the zip file
-either
  -run "run.bat"
or
  -use command prompt to:
  -compile the source code "javac DisableLocalizedGhostClicking/src/DisableLocalizedGhostClicking.java"
  -run it "java DisableLocalizedGhostClicking"
I prefer the 2nd option because your computer might not allow the 1st.

You can eztang00@gmail.com about any issues, especially cases where it crashes the computer.
